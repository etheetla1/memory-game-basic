**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program.

Submitted by: **ELISHA SUHAS THEETLA**

Time spent: **9** hours spent in total

Link to project: (https://glitch.com/edit/#!/chisel-arrow-metatarsal)

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

- [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
- [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked.
- [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked.
- [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
- [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess.
- [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
- [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
- [x] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
- [x] More than 4 functional game buttons
- [x] Playback speeds up on each turn
- [x] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
- [x] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
- [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
- [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
- [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Page automatically reloads after every game for a new pattern to be generated!
- [x] User can select between a difficulty level which changes length of the pattern and the speed of the game.

## Reflection Questions

1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)
   [While working on this project, I initially thought it was pretty easy to understand the code and follow the steps, and when I moved on to the optional features, it led me to think and work on a new regulation that would help me add more features and make the page look cooler. To be more specific, I found it a little challenging to make the computer play back the sequence of clues, including sound and visual cues for each button increase after every round, and when I started to work on it, I couldn’t figure out how much time should be reduced between reach round. After a lot of trial and error and research, I understood how much to reduce. While researching, I found answers to the rest of the additional items I wanted to add. This was the most confusing feature for me, but it was easy after I understood what to do. I then added a new feature where the player only loses after three mistakes (instead of on the first mistake). To do that, I said a mistake counter variable and every time the user makes a mistake, it is incremented, and when it reaches three, the loose game function gets called, and the game lost alert will pop up.]
3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   [I always have questions about how much more efficiently I can write my code. The first time I write code for anything, it isn’t the best most of the time, but when I look at it again after an hour, I find new ways to improve. Especially the concepts of loops and functions and how they have multiple ways of being written; I learn more and more as I keep writing more of them, and sometimes I end up writing the best code possible. Web development is something I had never done before and only had second-hand experience with, and when I attempted doing this project on my own with little help from google, a lot of it was similar to app development, and the same coding concepts were used everywhere but in different languages. The questions I have, keep getting answered by themselves as I practice and get involved in more projects. I want to dive deeper into the front-end development of a website and get fluent in HTML, j.script, CSS, python, react, cloud computing, and get an idea of everything to choose what I want to dive deep into.]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   [If I had a few more hours to work on this project, I wanted to implement the rest of the additional features that I could not include in my project. The segment where the game button appearance can change goes beyond just the color and adding sound to the Game button rather than just a single tone. The problem with that was that I could not attach it to the switch. I would have also liked to add a timer feature to count how long it took for the player to finish the game. I also wanted to change how the buttons looked into a rocket ship or an asteroid, but I did not have enough time to figure out a viable code.
